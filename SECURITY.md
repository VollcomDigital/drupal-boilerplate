## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** create public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use one of the following private channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (preferred):**
   - Go to the repository's **Security** tab.
   - Click **Report a vulnerability**.
2. If Security Advisories are unavailable, open a private issue with maintainers and clearly label it as `security`.

Include:

- Affected component(s) and version/commit
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if known)

## Response Targets

- Initial triage acknowledgement: within 3 business days
- Status update cadence: at least weekly until resolution
- Coordinated disclosure after a patch is available

## Responsible Disclosure

- Give maintainers reasonable time to investigate and patch.
- Avoid public disclosure before a fix or mitigation is released.
- Do not access data that is not yours.
- Do not run destructive tests against third-party systems.
